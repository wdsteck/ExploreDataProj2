# Repo: ExploreDataProj2

This repo contains the file to submit for the second Exploratory Data
class project.

It will contain R scripts to implement the project.

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National
Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate
matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period
1999â€“2008. You may use any R package you want to support your
analysis.

There are 6 questions to be answered. Each shall be answered with an
R script that creates a png plot. The script and the plot shall be loaded
into this repo.
